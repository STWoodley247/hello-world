# hello-world
This is my first attempt at using GitHub and I'm following the tutorial. I will also later use this as an area to file ideas for projects, big or small.
My name is Sam Woodley, currently 23 years old and primarily working as an engineer in the nuclear industry. I have always had an interest in programming, so I have recently started to teach myself as a possible new career path.
